# SWAN²
Savana Wildness Application for Neural Networks
##Introduction
This project is part of the "fil-rouge" optional project of third years of the informatics department at INSA de Lyon.
As it's a optional project we can choose what ever subject we wanted, so we decided to take advantage of this possibility
to discover unsupervised neural network possibilities.
##Installation
###Linux
install from command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/Xaxetrov/Fil-Rouge.git
cd Fil-Rouge/bin
qmake ../SAWN2.pro
make
```
You will need a Linux tool chain as well as a Qt tool chain.

For example on Ubuntu you can install all you need with:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential qt5-default 
```
