# SWAN²
Savana Wildness Application for Neural Networks
##Introduction
This project is part of the "fil-rouge" optional project of third years of the informatics department at INSA de Lyon.
As it's a optional project we can choose what ever subject we wanted, so we decided to take advantage of this possibility
to discover unsupervised neural network possibilities.
