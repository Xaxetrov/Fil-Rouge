# SWAN²
Savana Wildness Application for Neural Networks

[>>  Project video  <<](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45GLIzPV6BM)

##Introduction
This project is part of the "fil-rouge" optional project of third years of the informatics department at INSA de Lyon.
As it's a optional project we can choose what ever subject we wanted, so we decided to take advantage of this possibility
to discover unsupervised neural network possibilities.

##Installation
###Linux
to install from command line just run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Xaxetrov/Fil-Rouge.git
cd Fil-Rouge/bin
qmake ../SWAN2.pro
make
```
Then you just have to run the `SWAN2` file that you can found in your `Fil-Rouge/bin` folder.

You will need a Linux and Qt tool chain as well as git.

For example on Ubuntu you can install all you need with:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential qt5-default git
```
